# Daniel's Portfolio Website

Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio website and thank you for taking the time to check it out!

## [Project 1: Stock Forecasting](https://github.com/dani-dr06/Stock-forecast)
Using machine learning to predict stock performances? What could go wrong? In this project I have used a gradient boosting model to predict different stocks' performances, such as Spotify, Netflix, and Microsoft. The model performs pretty well at its task, at least on historical data! My next goal is to improve this project through the implementation of a neural network for this same task and compare performances. Disclaimer: do not take the model's results as financial advice.

## [Project 2: GameStats - a Video Games Dashboard](https://github.com/dani-dr06/VG-dashboard)
As a gamer myself, for this project, I carried out an interactive, database-driven video game sales and reviews dashboard using tools such as PyShiny and SQLite. The purpose of this dashboard is to allow the user to understand the data and easily get insights through a visually appealing interface. I have even included a [demo](https://github.com/dani-dr06/VG-dashboard#demo) in my project repo, which you should definitely check out!

## [Project 3: A/B Test for Marketing Campaigns](https://github.com/dani-dr06/ABtesting)
In this A/B test project, I compare experimental results from a fast food chain seeking to find the marketing campaign that offers the best return when it comes to sales. I first used an ANOVA and then I validated results using a Kruskal-Wallis test (since the data did not come from a normal distribution). Afterwards, I used Tukey's post-hoc test. The results show that the control group and group 3 seem to have performed better, but at the same time there was no statistically significant difference between the means of group 1 (control) and group 3 ... by the way, if you are wondering why the penguin picture, the penguin is trying to choose which of three watches it likes best - kind of like an A/B test.

## Other Ongoing Projects
- As I mentioned earlier, I am working on improving my stock forecasting project
- [Scratch-ML](https://github.com/dani-dr06/Scratch-ML): this is a long-term project I am starting to work on where I am implementing machine learning models from scratch to test/improve my knowledge of said models
