## [Project 1: K-Means Algorithm for Breast Cancer Data](https://github.com/dani-dr06/BreastCancerProject)
The purpose of this project is to carry out
a k-means algorithm in Python using Pandas and Numpy to analyze breast cancer data and predict the class of the patient
(benign cells or malignant cells) based on 9 attributes: 
* clump thickness, 
* uniformity of cell size
* uniformity of cell shape 
* marginal adhesion
* single epithelial cell size 
* bare nuclei 
* bland
* chromatin
* normal nucleoli 
* mitoses 

Although it is a fairly simple algorithm with some limitations, it was able to correctly predict the class about 96% of the time.
