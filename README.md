## [Project 1: Spotify EDA](https://github.com/dani-dr06/SpotifyEDA)
As a guitar player and an avid music lover, I thought it would be interesting to explore what the components of top hit songs are and gain new insights related to the making of top music hits. The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on Spotify music data, and later I try to predict song popularity based on the dataset's attributes via linear regression.

## [Project 2: K-Means Algorithm for Breast Cancer Data](https://github.com/dani-dr06/BreastCancerProject)
The purpose of this project is to carry out
a k-means algorithm in Python using Pandas and Numpy to analyze breast cancer data and predict the class of the patient
(benign cells or malignant cells) based on 9 attributes: 
1. Clump Thickness, 
2. Uniformity of Cell Size
3. Uniformity of Cell Shape 
4. Marginal Adhesion
5. Single Epithelial Cell Size 
6. Bare Nuclei 
7. Bland Chromatin
8. Normal Nucleoli 
9. Mitoses 

Although it is a fairly simple algorithm with some limitations, it was able to correctly predict the class about 96% of the time.

## [Project 3: Football Transfer Spending for Top 5 Leagues](https://github.com/dani-dr06/FootballProject)
For this project, I wanted to scrape data from the web and then use that data to work on visualizations, so I obtained data about transfer fee spending for the top 5 European football leagues (Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1), and I created different visualizations using Tableau to convey my findings.
