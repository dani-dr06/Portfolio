Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio website and thank you for taking the time to check it out!

## Projects

### Machine Learning / Deep Learning Projects
In addition to exploring machine learning applications of interest, these projects were created with the goal to demonstrate a proficiency in important machine and deep learning tools TensorFlow and sklearn in mind; therefore, I decided to group these projects together in this section.

Skills/tools showcased:
- TensorFlow
- Sklearn
- Regression
- Classification
- Dimensionality Reduction
- ANN, CNN, LSTM, Autoencoder

#### [Musk or Not](https://github.com/dani-dr06/MuskClassification)
Combined an Autoencoder for dimensionality reduction with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to determine whether molecules were musks or not.

#### [CatDog](https://github.com/dani-dr06/CatDog)
I experimented with building convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow for the task of classifying cat and dog images.


#### [Stock Forecasting](https://github.com/dani-dr06/Stock-forecast)
Using machine learning to predict stock performances? In this project I have used a gradient boosting model and an LSTM to predict different stocks' performances, such as Spotify, Netflix, and Microsoft. The models perform pretty well at its task, at least on historical data!

### [RAG](https://github.com/dani-dr06/RAGenerator)
The purpose of this project was to implement a framework powered by RAG using LangChain to allow for the creation of markdown files for a static website, therefore providing the most accurate information possible through AI generated content. This framework was used to create a static website for Virtual Tissue Simulation!

Skills/tools showcased:
- Neo4j
- LangChain
- OOP

### [GameStats - a Video Games Dashboard](https://github.com/dani-dr06/VG-dashboard)
As a gamer myself, for this project, I carried out an interactive, database-driven video game sales and reviews dashboard using tools such as PyShiny and SQLite. The purpose of this dashboard is to allow the user to understand the data and easily get insights through a visually appealing interface. I have even included a [demo](https://github.com/dani-dr06/VG-dashboard#demo) in my project repo, which you should definitely check out!

Skills/tools showcased:
- SQL
- Dashboard creation
- Shiny
- Pandas
- Geopandas
- Matplotlib

### [A/B Test for Marketing Campaigns](https://github.com/dani-dr06/ABtesting)
In this A/B test project, I compare experimental results from a fast food chain seeking to find the marketing campaign that offers the best return when it comes to sales. I first used an ANOVA and then I validated results using a Kruskal-Wallis test (since the data did not come from a normal distribution). Afterwards, I used Tukey's post-hoc test. The results show that the control group and group 3 seem to have performed better, but at the same time there was no statistically significant difference between the means of group 1 (control) and group 3 ... by the way, if you are wondering why the penguin picture, the penguin is trying to choose which of three watches it likes best - kind of like an A/B test.

Skills/tools showcased:
- Hypothesis testing
- A/B Testing
- SciPy
