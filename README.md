## Project 1:

## [Project 2: K-Means Algorithm for Breast Cancer Data](https://github.com/dani-dr06/BreastCancerProject)
The purpose of this project is to carry out
a k-means algorithm in Python using Pandas and Numpy to analyze breast cancer data and predict the class of the patient
(benign cells or malignant cells) based on 9 attributes: 
* clump thickness, 
* uniformity of cell size
* uniformity of cell shape 
* marginal adhesion
* single epithelial cell size 
* bare nuclei 
* bland
* chromatin
* normal nucleoli 
* mitoses 

Although it is a fairly simple algorithm with some limitations, it was able to correctly predict the class about 96% of the time.

## Project 3: Football Transfer Spending for Top 5 Leagues
For this project, I wanted to work on visualization, so I obtained data about transfer fee spending for the top 5 European football leagues (Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1), and I created different visualizations using Tableau to convey my findings.
