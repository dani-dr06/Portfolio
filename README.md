## [Project 2: K-Means Algorithm for Breast Cancer Data](https://github.com/dani-dr06/BreastCancerProject)
The purpose of this project is to carry out
a k-means algorithm in Python using Pandas and Numpy to analyze breast cancer data and predict the class of the patient
(benign cells or malignant cells) based on 9 attributes: 
1. Clump Thickness, 
2. Uniformity of Cell Size
3. Uniformity of Cell Shape 
4. Marginal Adhesion
5. Single Epithelial Cell Size 
6. Bare Nuclei 
7. Bland Chromatin
8. Normal Nucleoli 
9. Mitoses 

Although it is a fairly simple algorithm with some limitations, it was able to correctly predict the class about 96% of the time.

## [Project 3: Football Transfer Spending for Top 5 Leagues](https://github.com/dani-dr06/FootballProject)
For this project, I wanted to work on visualization, so I obtained data about transfer fee spending for the top 5 European football leagues (Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1), and I created different visualizations using Tableau to convey my findings.
